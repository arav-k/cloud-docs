= Stopping and Resuming Clusters
:description: You can stop and resume any cluster that has persistence enabled. Stopping a cluster saves your cluster's configuration and stops charges accumulating.

== Before you Begin

To stop clusters in a team, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Stopping a Cluster

Stopping your cluster can help minimize your costs during development because you are only charged for running clusters.

To stop a cluster, go to *Manage Cluster* and click *Stop*.

When you stop a cluster, Hazelcast Cloud saves your configuration so that you can resume the cluster at a later time.

== Resuming a Cluster

When you resume a cluster, Hazelcast restarts it with the same configuration as before it was stopped. Persisted data is also restored from disk. 

To resume a cluster after stopping it, go to *Manage Cluster* and click *Resume*.
