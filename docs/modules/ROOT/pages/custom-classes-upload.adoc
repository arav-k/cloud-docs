= Deploying Cluster-Side Modules to Hazelcast Cloud
:description: Before Hazelcast Cloud can execute or store your xref:cluster-side-modules.adoc[cluster-side modules], they need to be packaged into a single file and uploaded to Hazelcast Cloud. You can upload cluster-side modules, using the Hazelcast Cloud console, or the Maven plugin.

== Before you Begin

Check the xref:cluster-side-modules.adoc#prereqs, [requirements and limitations] to make sure that your code is ready to be packaged.

== Uploading Cluster-Side Modules

Hazelcast Cloud expects all classes of cluster-side modules to be packaged into a single ZIP or JAR file. When youâ€™ve built and packaged your cluster-side modules, the final step is to upload the resulting package file to Hazelcast Cloud.
