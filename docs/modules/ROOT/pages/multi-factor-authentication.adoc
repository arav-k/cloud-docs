== Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication

. Install an authenticator app such as Google Authenticator on your device.
. Click the *Account* icon in the bottom left corner.
. Click *Security*.
. Open your authenticator app and scan the QR code that is displayed in Hazelcast Cloud. 
. Enter the 6 digit verification code into the input box in Hazelcast Cloud and click *Enable two factor authentication*.
. Sign out and try signing in again.

After entering your username and password, you will be asked to enter the verification code, using the authenticator app.

Verification codes are specific to a particular device and cannot be transferred. If you switch to a new phone, you will need to <<disable, disable MFA>> before you do so, then re-enable it with your new phone.

== Disabling Multi-Factor Authentication
