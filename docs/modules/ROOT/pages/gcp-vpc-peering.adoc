There are 2 ways of creating a GCP VPC Peering connection:

- Use the CLI (recommended)
- Create a manual connection

To create a peering connection on a team cluster, you must have either an admin or developer role. See xref:teams-and-users.adoc[].

== Using the Hazelcast Cloud CLI

This option provides the easiest way of creating GCP VPC Peering with your Enterprise Hazelcast Cloud Cluster.
 
=== Set Up Your Environment

. Install link:{url-github-cloud-cli}[Hazelcast Cloud CLI].

. Set the `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` environment variable to the path to your Google Cloud credentials file. 
+
NOTE: You can check further details about *Google Application Credentials* in the link:{url-google-cloud-authentication}[Google Cloud documentation].

=== Creating a Peering Connection

. Create the peering connection.
+
[source,shell]
----
hzcloud gcp-peering create \
--cluster-id={YOUR_CLUSTER_ID} \
--project-id={YOUR_PROJECT_ID} \
--network-name={YOUR_VPC_NETWORK_NAME}
----
+
Make sure to replace the following placeholders:
+
- `YOUR_CLUSTER_ID` with the ID of your cluster.
+
To get your cluster ID, use the `hzcloud enterprise-cluster list` command of the Hazelcast Cloud CLI.
- `YOUR_PROJECT_ID` with the ID of your project which contains your network on Google Cloud.
+
For details about Google Cloud projects, see the link:{url-google-cloud-projects}[Google Cloud documentation].
- `YOUR_VPC_NETWORK_NAME` with the Name of your VPC network on Google Cloud 
on your terminal.
+
For details about Google Cloud VPC Networks, see the link:{url-google-cloud-vpc}[Google Cloud documentation].
+

. Check for active peerings from the VPC Network Peering tab after you select your VPC on Google Cloud Platform for your side of peering.

+
WARNING: Do not overlap the CIDR of your Hazelcast Dedicated cluster and the CIDR of your VPC, otherwise the connection will fail.

== Creating a Manual Connection

You can still create VPC peering without using Hazelcast Cloud CLI. But, you need to handle everything it does properly. This way is more difficult but more configurable.

In order to create VPC Peering, you need to do the following:

. Collect GCP Peering Properties for your Cluster with our API. 
. Create a GCP Peering connection from your side to our side.
. Accept our side of the GCP Peering connection you already sent with API.

=== Collecting Properties

You need to collect GCP Peering properties for your Enterprise Hazelcast Cloud cluster on GCP in order to create your side of the VPC Peering connection. 
You can get these properties from the link:{url-cloud-api}[GraphQL API] or the link:{url-github-go-sdk}[Hazelcast Cloud SDK Go] as the following command.

[tabs] 
====
GraphQL API:: 
+ 
--
[source,javascript]
----
query {
  gcpPeeringProperties(clusterId: "{YOUR_CLUSTER_ID}") {
    projectId
    networkName
  }
}
----
--
Hazelcast Cloud SDK:: 
+ 
--
[source,go]
----
client, _, _ := hazelcastcloud.New()
properties, _, _ := client.GcpPeering.GetProperties(context.Background(), &models.GetGcpPeeringPropertiesInput{
  ClusterId: "YOUR_CLUSTER_ID",
},
)
fmt.Println(properties.ProjectId)
fmt.Println(properties.NetworkName)
----
--
==== 

=== Creating a Peering Connection

After you successfully collect peering properties, you need to create a peering connection from your VPC to our VPC using values you collected from peering the properties previous step.

TIP: Learn how to create a VPC Peering Connection on Google Cloud in the link:{url-google-cloud-vpc-peering}[Google Cloud documentation].

=== Accepting a Peering Connection

After you successfully create a VPC Peering to the Hazelcast Dedicated Cluster, you need to accept that from our side by using the GraphQL API or the Hazelcast Cloud SDK Go as the following commands.

[tabs] 
====
GraphQL API:: 
+ 
--
[source,javascript]
----
mutation {
  acceptGcpPeering(input: {
    clusterId: "YOUR_CLUSTER_ID", 
    projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
    networkName: "YOUR_NETWORK_NAME" }){
    status
  }
}
----
--
Hazelcast Cloud SDK:: 
+ 
--
[source,go]
----
client, _, _ := hazelcastcloud.New()
result, _, _ := client.GcpPeering.Accept(context.Background(), &models.AcceptGcpPeeringInput{
  ClusterId:   "YOUR_CLUSTER_ID",
  ProjectId:   "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  NetworkName: "YOUR_NETWORK_NAME",
},
)
fmt.Println(result.Status)
----
--
==== 

=== Validating Peering Connections

After you see the status value as `Accepted`, you can check active peerings from the Peerings tab after you select your VPC on Google Cloud Platform for your side of peering. 

WARNING: The CIDR of your Hazelcast Dedicated Cluster and the CIDR of your VPC *should not be overlapped.* or you can not see peering in this list.

== Listing Peering Connections

You can list Google Cloud Platform peerings on your Enterprise Hazelcast Cluster on GCP from Console by going *Cluster Details > Settings > VPC Peerings* one by one as shown below. 
You can check where the connection established by checking Project ID and Network Name on the list.

Also, you can easily use Hazelcast Cloud SDK, Hazelcast Cloud CLI for this.

[tabs] 
====
Hazelcast Cloud CLI:: 
+

[source,shell]
----
hzcloud gcp-peering list --cluster-id={YOUR_CLUSTER_ID}
----
--
Hazelcast Cloud SDK:: 
+ 
--
[source,go]
----
client, _, _ := hazelcastcloud.New()
peerings, _, _ := client.GcpPeering.List(context.Background(), &models.ListGcpPeeringsInput{
  ClusterId:   "YOUR_CLUSTER_ID",
},
)
for _,peer := range *peerings {
  fmt.Println(peer.Id)
  fmt.Println(peer.NetworkName)
  fmt.Println(peer.ProjectId)
}
----

====

== Deleting Peering Connections

You can delete Google Cloud Platform peerings from your Hazelcast Dedicated cluster in the Hazelcast Cloud console as well as the Hazelcast Cloud SDK and the Hazelcast Cloud CLI.

[tabs] 
====
Hazelcast Cloud CLI:: 
+ 
--
[source,shell]
----
hzcloud gcp-peering delete --peeering-id={ID_OF_PEERING}
----
--
Hazelcast Cloud SDK:: 
+ 
--
[source,go]
----
client, _, _ := hazelcastcloud.New()
result, _, _ := client.GcpPeering.Delete(context.Background(), &models.DeleteGcpPeeringInput{
  Id: "ID_OF_PEERING",
},
)
fmt.Println(result)
